1. 
2. TDGCN loads the pre-processed data and adjacency/Laplacian matrices. 
  - It then trains the model using a GCN class, defined by Defferard's library
  - Finally, it evaluates the model on test data
  - N.B. The TDGCN code given here applies the GCN fitting and evaluation to imaginary data, from all 64 electrodes
  - Similar code was used for the executed data
  - TDGCN_1 applies the code to Brain Region 1
  - Similar code was used for the other 3 regions
