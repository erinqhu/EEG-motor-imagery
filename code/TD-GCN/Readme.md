1. 
2. TD-GCN loads the pre-processed data and adjacency/Laplacian matrices. 
  - It then trains the model using a GCN class, defined by Defferard's library
  - Finally, it evaluates the model on test data
  - N.B. The code given here applies the GCN fitting and evaluation to imaginary data, from all 64 electrodes
